# Go to *Dev branch* for running the project locally, and read the "README.md" in that branch

### If on VS code, run these commands
```
# Fetch all branches from the remote repository
git fetch origin

# Switch to the dev branch
git checkout dev
```
This is the demo branch who's app will be displayed in the *pitch meeting*, as it is the one being *hosted* on Digital Ocean and with out very own domain. The code will (mostly) remain the same, bar some changes that will need to occur during merging of the two branches. You cana give a look at this one if you want to see the configs and everything for webhosting, noting that if you want to run this version locally, it's a massive headache (you can't use vs code, it has to be done from the command line as vs code doesn't like env variables)
